Description: This package implements two variable importance estimators for 
    prediction of binary or continuous target variables. Namely, based on a 
    black-box prediction/regression model fit to the data, this approach yields 
    g-computation and augmented inverse probability weighted estimates of 
    variable importance, both described by Diaz et al (2014), and the targeted 
    maximum likelihood approach described in Diaz and van der Laan (2018). 
    This package relies on black-box prediction from the \code{sl3} package, 
    which, among other things, uses super learning (stacking) to make 
    predictions.
