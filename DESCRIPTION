Description: This package implements two variable importance estimators for prediction of binary or continuous target variables. Namely, based on a black-box prediction/regression model fit to the data, this approach yields g-computation and augmented inverse probability weighted estimates of variable importance, both described by Diaz et al (2014). This package relies on black-box prediction from the \code{sl3} package, which, among other things, uses super learning (stacking) to make predictions.
